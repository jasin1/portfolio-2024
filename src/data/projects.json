With countless resources and advice, it can be challenging to discern which plants are suitable for their specific location and current season. This complexity can lead to frustration and a lack of confidence in their gardening abilities. Additionally, the absence of a centralized platform for tracking personal experiences, plant care tips, and progress can hinder their growth and enjoyment in this new hobby."

The app integrates with a plant API, providing essential information like plant care, growth conditions, and images. Users can easily 'like' and save plants for future reference, creating their own personalized plant library. While it's an MVP, Garden Genius already streamlines plant care management, making gardening more approachable and fun for beginners."

        "content": "Building Garden Genius was both a technical and creative challenge. I started by planning the app’s architecture and user flow, ensuring it was simple enough for beginners while scalable for future features. I implemented React hooks like useState for managing dynamic data, useEffect to handle API calls for plant search functionality, and useContext to efficiently pass data across components, such as user-authentication status and saved plants. One of the more complex parts was developing the login and sign-up functionality, which included form validation and user state management. Ensuring data persisted across sessions while maintaining a smooth user experience was essential. Overcoming these technical challenges shaped the app into a responsive and user-friendly tool."

Users can search for plants by name, explore details like growth requirements, and save plants to a personal list. Future updates will expand functionality, including a note-taking feature where users can track plant progress and care tasks. Additionally, I'm planning to introduce a calendar for scheduling gardening activities, notifications for plant care, and even integration with smart gardening devices. As the app grows, Garden Genius aims to become a complete gardening assistant, helping users cultivate beautiful, thriving gardens with ease."
